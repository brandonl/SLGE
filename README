A time ago I stumbled across Ludum Dare where users particpate in 48 hour 'game jams' a while and decided to write my own small game engine in order to compete in such 'compos'. The goal of the project was an engine I could use to quickly make small 2D games. Because of this specification it uses the older and deprecated, fixed function pipeline in OpenGL.

The engine utilizes Box2D, OpenGL, and GLFW and was written in C++11-ish.
